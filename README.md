# 🧠 Decision Tree Classifier & Visualizer using Scikit-Learn

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building and visualizing a **Decision Tree** model using **Scikit-learn** to classify or predict outcomes on a chosen dataset. It demonstrates how decision trees work and how they can be interpreted for real-world applications.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a decision tree model for classification or prediction.
- Visualize the structure of the trained decision tree.
- Perform analysis and interpretation of the model results.

## 📁 Deliverable

A well-documented **Jupyter Notebook** including:
- Model training steps.
- Visualization of the decision tree.
- Model performance evaluation.
- Insights and analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
